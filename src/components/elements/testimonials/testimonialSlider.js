                                        <p>I worked with Efren extensively for 6+ years, often traveling with him to various photo shoots around the country. He was fantastically organized, thoughtful, and motivated both me, the crew, and his fellow SLB colleagues with a gentle manner that brought out the best in everyone. Efren is one of those wonderful art directors that you develop a healthy rapport with and that you're more than happy to go the extra mile on his behalf. Traveling for extended periods of time together often shows a person's true colors and personality, and I can say that Efren is a genuinely nice person, interesting, pleasant to be with, and thoughtful about his craft and work. I hope we get to work together again down the road.</p>

The two years we worked together at Schlumberger, I quickly realized that Efren is very dedicated to his work and has such great work ethic. He is a critical thinker and always delivered the results needed. I found it easy to work with Efren and he enjoyed sharing his knowledge and expertise wherever needed.</p>

During the years we worked together for Schlumberger as Art Directors, Efren demonstrated an impeccable professional ethic, exquisite creativity and above all, adaptability at the different times when the circumstances of "learning & growth" put us to the test. Efren took initiatives for his growth and transition to areas that were out of his comfort zone which position him today as an excellent and versatile creative. I won a friend for life with him and his beautiful family ... ohhh also expect donuts every Friday even though he knows you are on a diet!</p>

                                        <p>Efren is a multitalented art director. His ability to combine conceptual, creative and strategic thinking make him an asset to any creative project or campaign.<br />
                                            During our time together at Schlumberger, I found Efren to be very easy to work with. His dedication to his craft was evident and I saw him push himself to constantly add to his skill set. He recently completed a course in full stack web development and was able to immediately start applying his newly acquired skills to his job.<br />
                                            I highly recommend Efren for his ability to be both creative and analytical and proven success at Schlumberger executing creative visions by collaboratively working with marketing managers and strategists and a creative team.</p>

His design skill was a showcase to others on the team. Efrenâ€™s desire to always contribute in meaningful ways meant he was proactive on projects within the team, but also in his personal life where he attended school to learn new programming skills. He takes part in AIGA as a board member, and is always trying to improve his skillset. Efren is a punctual, responsive team player, and can run projects from start to completion. He would be an asset on anyone's team.</p>
